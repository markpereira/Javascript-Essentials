Operators example

var a = 5;
var b = "5";

if ( a === b ) {
	alert("Yes they are equal");
} else {
	alert("They are not equal");
}


// = assignment
// == equality
// === strict equality
// != not equals
// !== not strictly equal to
// (a > b)
// (a < b)
// (a >= b)
// (a <= b)
// ( (a === b) && (c===d) )  logical 'and'
// ( (a === b) || (c===d) )  logical 'or'

// all have to respond with true or false.

Modulus

// var year = 2003;
// var remainder = year % 4 // remainder 3

Increment and Decrement
a = a + 1;
a += 1;
a++;
++a;

Prefix and Postfix versions of the operators.
var a = 5;
alert(++a); will set new value to the variable and then add 1 - so answer will be 6.

var a = 5;
alert(a++); will provide the alert and then add 1 - so answer will still be 5.

Uninary - works on one operator
Binary - works on two operators (something on the let, and something on the right)


Ternary - works on three -  condition ? true : false (mini if / else statement)

How to turn into ternary operator - example

var playerOne = 500;
var playerTwo = 600;

//long code
var highScore =

if (playerOne > playerTwo) {
	highscore = playerOne;
} else {
	highscore = playerTwo;
}

//short code

var highScore = (playerOne > playerTwo) ? playerOne : playerTwo ;
